/** 
 * In Karelâ€™s world, a ballot consists of an arbitrary number of columns
 * that a voter can punch out. Every ballot column is exactly one space 
 * wide and three spaces high. The ballot card begins one square to the left
 * of the first column and ends one square to the right of the last column.
 * Karel always starts immediately to the left of the first ballot in the 
 * middle row of the ballot, facing East and the hole that gives Karel access 
 * to the voting area along the middle row of the ballot. Karel progresses 
 * through each column. Karel can travel along the middle row between 
 * the columns without hitting a wall. If a column contains a beeper in 
 * the middle, the voter did not intend to vote on that column, and Karel moves
 * to the next column. If a column contains no beeper in the middle, Karel 
 * makes sure that there is no hanging chad: Karel checks the column above and
 * below the middle row and removes any beepers. A column may contain any 
 * number of beepers. Karel ends execution facing East at the rightmost edge of 
 * the ballot in the middle row.
